# STA 141B final project


In this final project, your group is going to write a shiny application to show what you have learned in this course.
Each group would be 4 people. You have a option to pick one person as your partner. Use the google from to 
signup the partnership: https://forms.gle/RU5Y3L7c9irZnWHe7 (each pair please only submits once, deadline: Wednesday 12:00pm).
Two more people will be randomly assigned to your group. You don't have to do anything if you don't have any partner.

I will email the members of your group to you on 2/14 (btw, Happy valentine's day!)

You will need to demonstrate the techniques that you learn in this course. The first task is to obtain some data from the web. It could be either from an API or from web sites through web scrapping. With the application, any users (who do not necessarily have any statistics background) would be able to interact with the data, for example, via some graphical visualizations.

If you have no idea what you are going to do. This github repo contains a number of public API's  https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis or just google "web scraping ideas".

## Requirements

- Your shiny application.
    - The application should be uploaded to shinyapps.io and the source code should be make available to the public.
- A 4 page report contains
    - a brief introduction of the project
    - description of the source of data
    - how you retrieve and process the data
    - user guide of the application
- In the last week, your group will be given a chance to show your work to the class. The presentation will not be graded, however, it is a great chance for you to advertise your app to your classmates and me! 



## Project Update

- I hope that you have already started talking about the project.
- API / Webscrapping
- On Mar 10 or 12, each group will be given 5-10 minutes to present (depends on how many groups signed up)
- Indicate your choice on https://forms.gle/PwhfB36trovBFXox8 (each group only enter once)
- The presentation is not mandatory. Though, you could use this opportunity to show your work and get feedback from the class and me. I understand the work may not be completed at the time of the presentation (and that's why you need feedback). Also, note that it is not a disadvantage to present earlier on 3/12 because it means that your group has more time to implement the feedback.

- The due date for the shiny app and the report is 3/20 (though I encourage you to finish it soon).


## Some guidelines for the final project

- Is it usable? Make sure that it is free of any obvious bugs.
- Is it useful? It would be very boring if you built an application which counts the number of seconds since big bang.
- Coding style. You want your code to be clean and well documented. Just imagine another group will be taking charge of the maintenance of your app. (Hint: make use of `styler`)
- Is it user friendly. Of course , our course is not about software design but you do want to make sure that your app is not hard to use.
- Statistical correctness. You do not want to produce anything that are statistical wrong, for example, using a piechart to show a quantitative variable.
