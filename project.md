# STA 141B final project


In this final project, your group is going to write a shiny application to show what you have learned in this course.
Each group would be 4 people. You have a option to pick one person as your partner. Use the google from to 
signup the partnership: https://forms.gle/RU5Y3L7c9irZnWHe7 (each pair please only submits once, deadline: Wednesday 12:00pm).
Two more people will be randomly assigned to your group. You don't have to do anything if you don't have any partner.

I will email the members of your group to you on 2/14 (btw, Happy valentine's day!)

You will need to demonstrate the techniques that you learn in this course. The first task is to obtain some data from the web. It could be either from an API or from web sites through web scrapping. With the application, any users (who do not necessarily have any statistics background) would be able to interact with the data, for example, via some graphical visualizations.

If you have no idea what you are going to do. This github repo contains a number of public API's  https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis or just google "web scraping ideas".

## Requirements

- Your shiny application.
    - The application should be uploaded to shinyapps.io and the source code should be make available to the public.
- A 4 page report contains
    - a brief introduction of the project
    - description of the source of data
    - how you retrieve and process the data
    - user guide of the application
- In the last week, your group will be given a chance to show your work to the class. The presentation will not be graded, however, it is a great chance for you to advertise your app to your classmates and me! 

Details for the presentation and submission will be announced later.
